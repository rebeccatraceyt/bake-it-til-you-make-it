## User testing 
Family members and friends were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. Their helpful advice throughout the process led to many UX changes in order to create a better experience. 

It was through this testing that the following changes were made:
- Update to the Heads-up display to be more gamer-friendly.
- Change to Questions and Answers `font-size` in order to maintain readability on all devices
- Complete overhaul of Home Page to avoid dead space and to make the experience more intuitive.
- The addition of minutes to the **time counter** function for better readability.
- The addition of a **home button** along side the **play again** button at game end, allowing users to select where they want to go next.
- Using a star icon to represent the score counter on first entrance of the game play area in order to signify the type of content to be displayed.

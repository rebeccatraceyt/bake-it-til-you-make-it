#### Breakdown of Results

| Page | Error / Warning | Comment |
|:-----:|:---------------:|:-------|
| All Pages | Largest Contentful Paint | The images rendered on each page threw this error due to a number of reasons. The developer was able to pre-load images rendered using the `rel="preload"` attribute in **HTML** and using `-webkit-image-set()` in **CSS** ([Source](https://web.dev/preload-responsive-images/)). The problem still persists due to the use of third party images throughout the site.|
| All Pages | Render-blocking resources | This warning stems from the use of `emailJS` for the contact form. The developer attempted to resolve this issue using the `defer` attribute within the script tag, but this only created an issue whereby the function sending the email was not called. |
| Home Page | Tap targets not sized appropriately | Relating to the carousel controls. Issue was resolved by resizing the anchor tag of the controls. |
| Home Page | Defer offscreen images | This relates to the carousel feature of the home page. The researched solution was to 'lazy-load' the images but that is not an option in this release due to the use of image urls, in lieu of uploads. |
| My Favourites | Links are not crawlable | Relating to the `.page-link` class in the Bootstrap Pagination controls. |
| All Pages | Avoid enormous network payload | This warning relates to the use of external images throughout the site. The payload size fluctuated significantly because of this. The solution to this would be to upload images directly to the site, but this feature is not included in this release |
| Find Recipes | Size Images | This issue (like many others before) pertains to the use of external images, where the resource size is far greater than the displayed size. |
| All Pages | Does not use HTTPS | In researching this error, the only conclusive reason for it is the use of mixed content throughout the site. |

## User testing 
Family members and friends were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. Their helpful advice throughout the process led to many UX changes in order to create a better experience. 

It was through this testing that the following changes were made:
- Update to Logo to be more conventionally positioned. The original designs were for a floating logo but that was quickly replaced due to the issues it cause.
- Change to Recipe Card `font-size` and `max-length` in order to create consistency across all recipes. It was noted that some of the recipe names were longer than others, creating a spacing issue.
- Create conditional buttons for each category in order to better distinguish the differences.
- Create a 'quick-links' function for users to create a more streamline experience.
- Create a separate **Accounts Settings** page just for changing password or deleting account, in order to avoid the "danger" zone as much as possible.
- Create a live image preview window, allowing the user to see the current image on the **Edit User** and **Edit Recipe** pages.
- A **breadcrumbs** button on the Recipe page, allowing the users to return to their previous page for convenience. 
- Create a *Search Again* button on the **Find Recipes** search results in order to provide the user with easy return access.
